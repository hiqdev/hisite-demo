## Installation

Preferred way to install this project is through [composer]:

```sh
composer create-project --stability=dev "hiqdev/hisite-template:*" dir
```

To finish project installation run:

```sh
./vendor/bin/hidev deploy
```

You will see:

```
Created dir:  ./public/
Created dir:  ./public/assets/
chmod ./public/assets '0777'
chmod ./runtime '0777'
```

And that's it &mdash; the project is ready to be served with web server.
But [hidev] can do a bit more for you.

Also see more on recommended [Directory structure] of this template.

[Directory structure]: docs/DirectoryStructure.md

### Generate and install NGINX vhost config

Copy [.env.dist] to `.env` and tune it to set project wide options:

- `ENV` - environment env/prod, will be used to setup `YII_ENV` constant
- `SSL` - enable SSL, used for NGINX config
- `HOSTS` - hostname(s), used for NGINX config

To see generated NGINX config without actually installing it use the following command:

```sh
./vendor/bin/hidev nginx/dump
```

To install config and restart NGINX run:

```sh
./vendor/bin/hidev nginx/deploy
```
